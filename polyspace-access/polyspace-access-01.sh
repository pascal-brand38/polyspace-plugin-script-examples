# Example of polyspace access usage in ***JenkinsPlugin***
# Please refer to ***https://github.com/mathworks/plugin*** in order to configure the
# jenkins plugin
#
# Different steps are used
# 1- Sniff the project
# 2- Run Bug Finder or Code Prover
# 3- Upload results on Polyspace Access
# 4- Export report and filter only the defects "High"
# 5- Send email with the report
#

set -e
export RESULT=ResultBF
export PROG=Bug_Finder_Example
export PARENT_PROJECT_ON_ACCESS=/public/access/access-01
rm -rf Notification && mkdir -p Notification



#
# 1- Sniff the project
#    Pre-requite: the sources must be checkout in the workspace
#                 this can be performed using the jenkins git plugin: https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-plugin
#
build_cmd="gcc -c sources/*.c"
polyspace-configure \
      -allow-overwrite \
      -allow-build-error \
      -prog $PROG \
      -author jenkins \
      -output-options-file $PROG.psopts \
      $build_cmd

#
# 2- Run Bug Finder
#
polyspace-bug-finder-server -options-file $PROG.psopts -results-dir $RESULT

#
# 3- Upload results on Polyspace Access
#
$ps_helper_access -create-project $PARENT_PROJECT_ON_ACCESS
$ps_helper_access \
      -upload $RESULT \
      -parent-project $PARENT_PROJECT_ON_ACCESS \
      -project $PROG

#
# 4- Export report and filter only the defects "High"
#
$ps_helper_access \
      -export $PARENT_PROJECT_ON_ACCESS/$PROG \
      -o Notification/Results_All.tsv \
      -defects High


#
# 5- Send email with the report
#
#
# Performed by the post-build action, when Polyspace Notification post-build action
# is parametrized as:
#
#   Send to recipients [Checked]
#     Recipients: Users to receive the notification, separated by commas
#     File to attach: Notification/Results_All.tsv
#     Mail Subject: <empty>
#     Mail Body: <empty>
#
#   Send to Owners [Unchecked]
